### Workflow Changes

1. **Environment Variables for Context Information**:
   - The workflow now captures the repository name, branch name, commit author, and commit message and stores them in environment variables. This is a good practice as it centralizes context information that can be used throughout the workflow and in the application.
   - The use of `echo` to set environment variables is appropriate for simple use cases, but it's worth noting that this method is not recommended for production workflows due to security concerns. It's better to use GitHub Actions' built-in ways to set environment variables securely.

2. **New Steps for Context Information**:
   - The workflow now includes steps to print the captured context information. This is useful for debugging and understanding the workflow's environment, but in a production workflow, this might be unnecessary and could be removed.

3. **Enhanced Environment Variables**:
   - The workflow now includes additional environment variables for WeChat and OpenAI configurations. This is a good practice as it separates configuration from code, making it easier to manage and change.

### Code Changes

1. **Main Class Changes**:
   - The `main` method now initializes `GitCommand`, `WeiXin`, and `IOpenAI` objects using environment variables. This is a good practice as it makes the application more configurable and easier to deploy in different environments.
   - The `getEnv` method is introduced to retrieve environment variables, which centralizes the environment variable retrieval logic and makes the code cleaner.

2. **Removed Direct Token Usage**:
   - The direct usage of the `github_token` environment variable in the `main` method has been removed, which is a security improvement. Now, the token is retrieved through the `getEnv` method, which is more secure.

3. **Logging**:
   - The `logger.info` statement has been added to indicate the completion of the code review process. This is a good practice for logging important events in the application.

### General Observations

- **Security**: The workflow now uses environment variables for sensitive information, which is a good practice. However, ensure that all secrets are properly managed and not exposed in the codebase.
- **Error Handling**: The code now includes checks for null or empty environment variable values, which helps prevent runtime exceptions. Ensure that all possible failure points are handled gracefully.
- **Code Review SDK**: The workflow and application code seem to be tightly coupled with the `openai-code-review-sdk`. Consider if this is the best architectural decision, as it may limit the flexibility and reusability of the application.

Overall, the changes seem to improve the workflow and application code by centralizing configuration, enhancing security, and providing more context information. However, it's important to ensure that all changes are thoroughly tested to verify that they work as expected and do not introduce new issues.
